Test input data in *.defs.
Expected test output in *.scan.json for scan test.

No test output for *-err.defs

Note that order of fields in JSON objects is undefined; hence outputs
may not compare using textual comparison.  However, outputs produced
using json_pp should always compare equal for correct output.
